NAME
    Cogit - A truly Pure Perl interface to Git repositories

VERSION
    version 0.001000

SYNOPSIS
        my $git = Cogit->new(
            directory => '/path/to/git/'
        );
        $git->master->committer;
        $git->master->comment;
        $git->get_object($git->master->tree);

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a Pure Perl interface to Git repositories.

    It was mostly based on Grit <http://grit.rubyforge.org/>.

HERE BE DRAGONS
    This module's API is not yet battle tested. Feel free to try it out, but
    don't depend on it for serious stuff yet. Comments regarding the API
    very welcome.

METHODS
    master
    get_object
    get_object_packed
    get_object_loose
    create_object
    all_sha1s

FORK
    This module was forked from Git::PurePerl for a couple reasons. First
    and foremost, "Git::PurePerl" is based on Moose, which is not pure perl.
    Secondarily the API was very weird, with differentiations made based on
    whether or not an object was in the repo or not.
